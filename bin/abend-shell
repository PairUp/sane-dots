## Run args as command. On exit 0 do nothing, on exit 1 fall back to shell.
# Good for when you want to `exec` blindly. E.g.: exec abend-shell volatilecmd

# Note: Only designed for simple commands at the moment. Will have to be
# reworked a bit to allow things like:
#  abend-shell '(cd /tmp; ls)'
# or:
#  abend-shell someshellfunction
